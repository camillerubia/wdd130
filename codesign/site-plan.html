        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The sole purpose of this page is to introduce coDesign, its virtual environment, 
        and set the user's expectation of the services provided, and pricing.<br/><br/>

        Are you looking for a web developer who can make your ideas digitally happen 
        for a reasonable price? Do you own a small business and have no idea where to 
        start to make your business known in the digital world? Or perhaps you own a 
        company and wish to make little tweaks here and there in your old website or 
        to make it entirely new?<br/><br/>

        You came to the right website! Here at coDesign, we make ideas happen! We 
        provide a new and reliable approach to building a website.<br/><br/>

        You don't need to go anywhere. We can meet with you virtually! Save more 
        time because our services would all be entirely remote!<br/><br/>

        The home page also includes small sections of packages and FAQ. Where the 
        package consists of Basic and Premium: varying from the number of pages, type 
        of design, and number of revisions as desired by the client. The FAQ section 
        will answer some questions on former projects created, available discounts, 
        the language used, delivery time, hosting provider, and the design plan.<br/><br/>
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Dev Page</h3>
      <p>
        The Dev Page as the name suggests refers to Developer's Page. Its purpose is to 
        introduce the developer and create great connections through experiences, passion 
        for creativity, and business. It summarizes personal and professional work 
        describing what she does; this enables the clients to see her full potential, 
        identity, values, and principles.<br/><br/>

        The users will also see the gallery of the finished websites created by the 
        developer and brief details of either the process involved or the tools used 
        for the former projects.<br/><br/>

        The page talks about the plans and goals which lets the client know that the 
        developer aims to be fully coordinated to achieve the desired website design/build. 
        Which means creating the initial trust that leads to conversion 
        (from visitor to client).<br/><br/>

        The main developer is Camille Nica Rubia, currently a student at BYU Idaho who 
        formerly studied Computer Secretarial years ago. She was initially inspired by 
        her husband, a front-end web developer in creating and designing websites. She 
        found this very interesting, how lines of code could create almost stylish and 
        neat websites which we usually visit and use today. As a business-minded like 
        her, she wanted to help entrepreneurs to have their own space in the digital 
        world to showcase their products online. Her lifetime dream is to be able to 
        show her creativity while helping others in whatever manner she can: whether 
        it be digitally, virtually, or physically.<br/><br/>

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        This page enables the user to input their details (including their 
        company/business name) to request either of the following: further details, 
        clarifications, quotations, advice, or extend an agreement or contract.<br/><br/>

        The Contact Us page will require them to input their first name, last name, 
        email address, contact number (if preferred), and much more importantly, the 
        company name they chose (or the existing company name). The business name 
        (or the company name) is required because this is where the main design or 
        concept of the website will be based.<br/><br/>

        This page is crucial for the most part because the conversion process will 
        start here. The initial contact would depend on the client/user's preference. 
        It could be any communication of their choosing. Discussions could be held 
        through Zoom meetings, phone calls, or via email. This communication will 
        also determine the payment process for the services provided to them.<br/><br/>

        This page will be the key to setting the expectations of both the client and 
        the developer. We are eager to help and guide starting entrepreneurs to make 
        their businesses known in the digital world.<br/><br/>

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        Home page and the other sections will be divided using the parallax scrolling.
        Where when the user scrolls up, the navigation bar will be more visible than the
        first page of the home.

        the name of the website created aside from the details on the bottom of the picture.
