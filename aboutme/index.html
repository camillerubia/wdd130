    <h2>'Nica'</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Camille, but you can call me Nica. I am already 
        married for two years, but we don't have any children yet. I have been a 
        member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was eight. 
        I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology. I am still new to programming, and I have found 
        this exciting and a way to get out of my comfort zone.</p>
